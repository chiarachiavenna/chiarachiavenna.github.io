Welcome to my webpage!

I am a full time postdoctoral scientist at Bocconi University, affiliated to the Covid Crisis Lab and Dondena research centre.

Previously, I completed my PhD at the University of Cambridge and a one-year project at Public Health England. 

My research interests focus on statistical models to make inference from longitudinal observational health data, mostly collected through surveillance systems. 

As a PhD student, I spent 4 years at the MRC Biostatistics Unit, investigating time-series methods to quantify the burden of bacterial respiratory infections secondary to influenza, in seasonal and pandemic settings, from surveillance data. 

At Public Health England, I worked jointly with the Statistics unit and the HIV department, using counterfactual methods to quantify the impact of interventions: I estimated the excess mortality due to COVID-19 and the effectiveness of HIV prophylaxis within the PrEP Impact trial. 

Prior to starting my PhD, I completed a degree in Statistics and a Master's degree in Biostatistics at the University of Milano-Bicocca, and did my Masterâ€™s thesis at the Karolinska Institute.
