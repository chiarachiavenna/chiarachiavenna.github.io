Welcome to my webpage!

I am currently a senior postdoctoral scientist at Bocconi University in Alessia Melegaro's group, affiliated with the Covid Crisis Lab and the Dondena Research Centre.
Before joining Bocconi in 2021, I earned my **PhD** from the **University of Cambridge** (2020) and completed a year-long project at the UK Health Security Agency.
Earlier in my academic journey, I obtained a degree in Statistics (2012) and a Master's in Biostatistics (2015) from the University of Milano-Bicocca, and I did an internship at the Karolinska Institute to work on a Masterâ€™s thesis project.

My research centers on **statistical methods** designed to draw inferences from **observational health data**, primarily within the domain of **infectious disease** research. The projects I undertake are always motivated by public health questions, addressing issues such as quantifying disease burden, assessing health policies, and exploring sociodemographic factors.
